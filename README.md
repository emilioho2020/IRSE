# IRSE part 2

## TODO
- Spread out ARGS class?
- Compare our data pre-processing strategies
I'd stick to pytorch as a back-end, as it provides more control over the training process and loss function.
This means we'll use your training code as a base. 
- expand model
- implement 3-phase training algorithm
- select evaluation algorithm, should already be implemented
